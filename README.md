## What you will need to start
### Install Python (If you haven't already)
For this project, we will be using python (This bot, specifically, is running on Python 3.7.9). You can download and install at https://www.python.org/downloads/ and check whether it is installed properly on your computer by typing ```python3 --version``` in your terminal. It should output the correct Python version that you've downloaded.

### Install an IDE for Python 
You don't necessarily need an IDE for this project, but it is highly recommended to get used to a specific Python IDE for both this project and future projects. For the Twitter Bot, I used Atom Text Editor which is decently popular among Python Developers. If necessary, download the latest version at https://atom.io/

## Setting up a Twitter Development Account
### Step 1: Fill Out A Twitter Developer Application
Assuming you have a twitter account to use for this project (recommend creating a totally separate account just for this project), go to https://developer.twitter.com/en and log in with your account credentials. Once you're in the Twitter Developer Portal/Dashboard, click "Create New App" and fill out the necessary fields. This can honestly be whatever you want, but make sure the App Permissions are set to "Read, Write, and Direct Messages". This is important because you will want your Twitter Bot to be able to not only read data on Twitter but also post tweets.
### Step 2: Get Keys and Access Tokens
Once your Developer App is completed and approved, all you need to do now is get your API keys and Access Tokens! To do this, go to your Developer Portal/Dashboard and find the app you just created under "Projects".
